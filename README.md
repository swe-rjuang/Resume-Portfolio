# Rick Juang | Professional Game Engineering Portfolio

This repository hosts a modern, single-page, and fully responsive **Game Engineering Portfolio** designed to showcase technical contributions across various game titles, including *Aliens: Fireteam Elite*, *Zwift*, *TRON: Evolution*, and *flOw*.

The portfolio emphasizes expertise in **core game systems, AI behaviors, and tools development**, presented in a clean, high-contrast dark theme.

## Key Features

* **Single-File Deployment:** The entire portfolio—structure, styling, and interactivity—is self-contained in `index.html` for extremely lightweight, dependency-free hosting on GitHub Pages or any static server.

* **Fully Responsive Design:** The layout, built using **Tailwind CSS**, is optimized to provide an excellent viewing and browsing experience across all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

* **Interactive Project Carousel:** A horizontal, draggable thumbnail panel allows for quick discovery and selection of featured projects.

* **Dynamic Detail Loading:** All project content, contributions, and media are loaded instantly via **Vanilla JavaScript** upon clicking a thumbnail, avoiding full page reloads.

* **Detailed Technical Stack:** Each project features visually distinct, color-coded tags indicating the specific technologies and domains of expertise (e.g., C++, Unreal Engine, AI, Multiplayer, Build Pipeline, UI).
